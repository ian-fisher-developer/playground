# FizzBuzz Kata

Practices test-driven-development for the child's arithmetic game, counting up the positive integers, replacing certain numbers with names.

- For numbers divisible by three, say "fizz"
- Divisible by five, say "buzz"
- Divisible by both -- "fizzbuzz"

If you never played this game in early school, I promise it is fun -- go around the class, each student saying the next item, and see the eyes go wide for the unfortunate student after a rapid sequence of fizzes and buzzes, "Erm...where did we get to?"
